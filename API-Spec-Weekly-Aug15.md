**Interesting Issues**
[GraphQL over HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md) - This specification details how GraphQL should be served and consumed over HTTP in order to maximize interoperability between clients, servers and tools. This specification does not override or replace the [GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/), it extends it to cover the topic of serving GraphQL services over HTTP. If any statement or algorithm in this specification appears to conflict with the GraphQL specification, the behavior detailed in the GraphQL specification should be used. 

**Interesting discussions**
- [What is GraphQL?](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1017) - The GraphQL spec has two definitions; this discussion attempts to revise the definition and explore the true nature of GraphQL.
- [SDL file - its role and purpose in GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1019) - The story is different from other protocols (gRPC, Thrift), and from expectations of the average new-comer. The term SDL is also never explained in the spec.

**Interesting Issues**
[Introduce new schema referencing standard](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/pull/825) -  The current reference object is no longer sufficient as we need to support non-JSON references, i.e. we can no longer solely rely on [JSON Reference](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03). The main problem becomes that AsyncAPI is defined with JSON/YAML and you are referencing something that does not conform to this format. Hence making it tough to support. This new standard aims to solve this problem.

[The mutually-exclusive url and identifier properties of License object are optional in specification and required in schema](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/2975) - In the definition of the [License object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#licenseObject) of OpenAPI 3.1: the `url` and `identifier` properties are not marked as REQUIRED, but optional, and are defined as mutually exclusive.
